# UdaSecurity

As final project of the [Java Programming Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/java-programming-nanodegree--nd079) a home security application was given, that alarms the user when one of the sensors detects a cat.
The provided source code enables the user to create such sensors, scan images and put the system in different arming status.


## Requirements

The assignment's goals focused on implementing the following tasks:
- Find missing dependencies and add them to pom.xml 
- Split the project into two modules, each following the conventional maven structure
- Write unit tests to confirm the system's requirements (Unit tests are located at `/securityService/src/test/`)
- Fix any errors in the given source code that do not pass the unit tests
- Deploy the application into an executable JAR


## Installation

1. `cd securityService/target`
2. `java -jar securityService-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`

The project was built using Java 14 and Maven 3.8.4.
